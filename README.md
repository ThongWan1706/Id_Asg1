<h1>The Glided Key</h1>
The Glided Key is founded by Thong Wan , which focus on selling top quality jewelries with an affordable price. We believe that every one deserved to show their own unique beauty with accessories that they can afford, as accessories are very pricey due to its unique craftwork.

<h1>Design Process</h1>
Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory) Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.
