          I've been a shopper for a while. Overall the shop is decent but
          personally I think the quality and service can be improve. I'm happy
          to give them credit for their excellent selection of accessories. They
          genuinely offer some trendy and interesting pieces, and the price are
          affordable. This is great stop if you purely for variety on budget.

          However, the reason I'm rating 3 stars is the inconsistency in
          quality. While some of the items I had brought had helf up
          wonderfully, a few others specifically the strap of the autumn
          bracelet broke much sooner than I expected. I understand affordable
          pricing sometimes means compromises, but I prefer a little more
          durability across the board. If the quality control are better,
          definetely it will be a good 4 or 5 star store. I'll continue to shop
          here but definetely need to pay more attention to the quality before
          buying.
